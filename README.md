# Android  IOExtended Demo
 
 This demo application is part of a GDGKC event for IO Extended on Jetpack Compose. Compose is a new way of building UI's for Android. This demo utilizes a list/detail application based on the US State Birds. It includes images and data by way of a json file. This application uses Material 3 design through out the project. The theme is setup to adapt based on your wallpaper.

 This application was built on the Android Studio Canary build Iguana. Along with this version of Android Studio comes Studio Bot, which I used for different aspects of this project. This project also uses kotlin instead of gradle for the build. This was a small challenge when it came to adding implementations. 

Below are a series of screenshots that show this application supporting normal, medium and large screen sizes. Including Foldables
